# The Upside Down Dimension of Elixir

## An introduction to Meta-programming

Open the gate and enter into the Upside Down Dimension of Elixir that is metaprogramming. If you have become frustrated with boilerplate code in your modules, wanted to program in a language closer to your domain, or create new programming constructs in Elixir, then this presentation is for you. The format of this talk is a gentle introduction presenting key concepts reinforced with code demos. At the end of the presentation, you will have the tools to write basic macros and a solid foundation to explore more advanced concepts on your own.
